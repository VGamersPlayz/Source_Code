Why I chose GitHub?

GitHub is a popular platform for programmers and developers because it makes teamwork and coding projects easier. It allows people to store and share their code in one place, so everyone on a team can access the latest version. With GitHub, you can track changes made to your code, fix mistakes, and even go back to an older version if something goes wrong. It's also a great way to showcase your work, as others can see your projects and how you solve problems. For beginners like me, GitHub is a tool that helps keep coding organized and collaborative.
